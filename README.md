## About:

Frontend Developer focused on building responsive, scalable, and high-performance web applications using React.js, Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

I develop reusable UI components, integrate REST APIs, and deliver clean, accessible interfaces. I'm comfortable working in Agile teams and use tools like Git, Figma, and Jira, while continuously learning and optimizing for performance.

I'm actively seeking frontend developer roles where I can contribute, collaborate with skilled teams, and continue growing as a React engineer. Open to remote opportunities.
